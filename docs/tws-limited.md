We have partnered with amazing small businesses to make unique color combination and laser engraving the Wooden Sound Systems to generate awareness and boost engagement for various occasions. 

### B2B Sales

As a boutique store owner you have an amazing potential for reaching out local startups and big corporations for presenting hand-crafted functional design objects that you already sell but with some custom color and laser engraving options you can even make it very attractive for those businesses. 

We love to make your custom requirements match with min orders starting from as low as 7 units on each order. 

#### How to pitch to your local businesses for corporate gift/swag supply

You can use your most powerful choice of contact;

* Social media is a great way to slide in DM's of a specific person, this can be Twitter, IG or even LinkedIn. 

* Cold e-mail but with a bit of customization and to the point story telling can make a huge leaps possible.

* Using your network for asking recommendations or introductions. In the end you're pitching an award-winning and already good selling product with a highly customized way. You can even gift one unit to your friends if they suggest a lead. 

Of course there are hundreds of other ways of achieving similar results. These are just some quick thought provoking examples to generate more action in a shorter time.

### Create awareness

Fund raising for donations is also one aspect we love to contribute. One of our super stores, Unfurl, requested an ocean themed swirl edition TWS to sell in an auction for donating their chosen ocean cleaning foundation.
