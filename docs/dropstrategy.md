One successful Drop Strategy campaign we did was with [Superstore Unfurl](https://www.bitti-gitti.com/super-store/unfurl). Together, we co-created an ocean-inspired Swirl Edition of the Wooden Sound System. Unfurl sold all of them in an auction, raising awareness and money for cleaning the oceans.

Another one was for [Unfurl's 20th birthday!](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=962824735845116&id=100063527952659&paipv=0&eav=Afb1dTEVf3aj2ybQclsujZss6P5ehCzHp1EaQxcPPe9aSmwoFTC5iaBcBGsdHvr_bCc&_rdr) which we gladly took a part to make an everlasting product unique to Unfurl customers only.
