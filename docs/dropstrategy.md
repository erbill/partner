## Partnering with Bitti Gitti

At Bitti Gitti, we specialize in creating unique and handcrafted design objects using our original Flowcraftâ„¢ method. Our Wooden Sound System has become widely popular due to its award-winning design and remarkable audio experience. Partnering with us allows you to create exclusive offers that promote your brand and engage your customers in a meaningful way.

## Ocean Inspired Swirl Edition - The Unfurl Campaign

One successful Drop Strategy campaign we did was with Superstore Unfurl. Together, we co-created an ocean-inspired Swirl Edition of the Wooden Sound System. Unfurl sold all of them in an auction, raising awareness and money for cleaning the oceans.

## Steamboat Willie Edition - A New Genre of Customers

With the iconic Steamboat Willie becoming public domain, we introduced a lasered version of the Wooden Sound System featuring this beloved character. This edition became a huge hit, attracting a new genre of customers who might otherwise never have heard about the product.

## Collaborating with Local Artists

Another way to implement the Drop Strategy is by collaborating with local artists. We can offer customized Wooden Sound Systems on which they can paint their unique artwork. This creates a limited edition offer that will excite your customers while also promoting local talent.
