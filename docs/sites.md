## One Link

This simple tool generates a website for you to present all of your social and other links in one page. This is a website which lives on it's url so it's pretty long when you create it. But you can use any URL shorteners to make a custom webpage with a custom link.

## Crossword Maker (Beta)

This is a really challenging task for us, but we're on it. To boost the pressure on us, we'd like to share our beta version with your curious minds. There's the simple crossword maker at the main page, and there's also one word, word finder game generator accessible from the link under the corssword. Idea is to let you add any word combinations you want and get a quite nice looking crossword where you can share on social media to boost engagement and view time. 

Let us know what you think!
